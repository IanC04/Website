            <i>Java</i> is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and
            colleagues at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Unlike conventional languages which
            are generally designed either to be compiled to native (machine) code, or to be
            interpreted from source code at runtime, Java is intended to be compiled to a bytecode,
            which is then run (generally using JIT compilation) by a Java Virtual Machine.

            The language itself borrows much syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model
            and fewer low-level facilities. Java is only distantly related to JavaScript, though
            they have similar names and share a C-like syntax.
