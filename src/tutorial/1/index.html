        <h2>Setup and Features</h2>
        <p>
            In this chapter, you will learn how Java is run and processed by your computer.
            Additionally, you’ll learn how to create your own Java file and application.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1 JDK</h3>
        <p>
            The JDK is the Java Development Kit, which allows us to create code. The JDK includes
            tools useful for developing and testing programs written in the Java programming
            language and running on the Java platform.
        </p>
        <h4>1.1.1 Versions</h4>
        <p>
            Java has had many version updates, now at Standard Edition(SE) 18. We generally don’t
            use the advanced features, but it’s still good to know them. The newer the version, the
            more features, classes, and methods.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 JRE</h3>
        <p>
            JRE, Java Runtime Environment, houses the resources to run a Java program. It is a
            software layer that runs on top of a computer’s operating system software and provides
            the class libraries and other resources that a specific Java program needs to run.
            Besides the JVM, it also houses other toolkits and libraries.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3 JVM</h3>
        <p>
            JVM is Java Virtual Machine, which actually runs Java programs.
            It executes applications by loading code, verifying code, executing code.
            Additionally, it provides the runtime environment.
            It also defines core system components, including the memory area, class file
            format, register set, garbage-collected heap, and fatal error reporting mechanisms.
        </p>

        <h3>1.4 Startup</h3>
        <p>
            There are two main ways to run your Java code.
            First, you can use terminal commands.
            <br>
            <code>javac [ options ] sourcefiles</code> compiles your source code.
            <br>
            <code>java [options] ClassName [arguments]</code> runs the program.
            <br>
            Next, you can use an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE.
            They consist of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.
